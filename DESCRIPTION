Authors@R: c(person("Rich", "FitzJohn", role = c("aut", "cre"),
                    email = "rich.fitzjohn@gmail.com"),
             person("John", "Lees", role = "aut"),

Description: Less painful than it sounds, this package compiles an
    odin model to use dust, our new stochastic model system. Supports
    only a subset of odin models (discrete time stochastic models with
    no interpolation and no delays).
